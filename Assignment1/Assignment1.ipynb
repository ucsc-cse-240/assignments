    "For each of the following questions, implement the corresponding search algorithm and return the list of tiles visited, in order. In Python's chess module, each tile has an integer id corresponding to it, where `'A1' = 0`, `'A2' = 1`, etc, and they are really just treated as integers by the chess module. Each chess square is equivalent to a number ranging from `0` to `63`, going from left to right, one row at at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the knight starting on tile `'A1' = 0` and moving through tiles `'A1' = 0`, `'B3' = 17`, and `'D2' = 11`, in that order, before finally reaching the destination `'F1' = 5` would be represented by the list `[0, 17, 11, 5]`. Please note, this conversion from `A1` to `0` happens automatically, so please don't be confused if you added a chess tile to your list and saw it as an integer when you print it out; it is really the same thing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because there is no opponent here, so you will have to set the `board.turn` property after every turn and make it the turn of the first player again.\n",
    "\n",
    "As one final piece of advice, it is not necessary to invent any grand new functions here to help you interface with the chess board. If you have an idea for something but it seems like a lot of work to implement on your own, there may very well be a built-in chess module function that can do it for you. Please have a look before diving in head-first.\n",

    #   gamma which is another parameter helpful in calculating next move, in other words  
    #            gamma is used to blalance immediate and future reward
    #   Q is the q-table used in Q-learning
    #   N is the next state used to explore possible moves and decide the best one before updating
    #           the q-table

    #   determines which move(s) it can make by also using the 
    #   board variables to see if its near a wall or if  the
    #   moves it can make lead it into the snake body and so on. 
    #   This can return a list of variables that help you keep track of
    #   conditions mentioned above.

    #   This is the code you need to write. 
    #   This is the reinforcement learning agent
    #   use the helper_func you need to write above to
    #   decide which move is the best move that the snake needs to make 
    #   using the compute reward function defined above. 
    #   This function also keeps track of the fact that we are in 
    #   training state or testing state so that it can decide if it needs
    #   to update the Q variable. It can use the N variable to test outcomes
    #   of possible moves it can make. 
    #   the LPC variable can be used to determine the learning rate (lr), but if 
    #   you're stuck on how to do this, just use a learning rate of 0.7 first,
    #   get your code to work then work on this.
    #   gamma is another useful parameter to determine the learning rate.
    #   based on the lr, reward, and gamma values you can update the q-table.
    #   If you're not in training mode, use the q-table loaded (already done)
    #   to make moves based on that.
    #   the only thing this function should return is the best action to take
    #   ie. (0 or 1 or 2 or 3) respectively. 
    #   The parameters defined should be enough. If you want to describe more elaborate
    #   states as mentioned in helper_func, use the state variable to contain all that.
